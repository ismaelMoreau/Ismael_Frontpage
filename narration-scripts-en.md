# Narration Scripts — English Audio Tour

Scripts for generating TTS audio files. Each section is approximately 20-25 seconds.

---

## Intro (~15s)

> Hey. I'm Ismaël.
> I've been building things with code for eight years now.
> Distributed systems, video games, DevOps pipelines...
> And now, A I agents that work for me.
> Let me show you how I got here.

---

## Act 1: The Foundations (~24s)

> 2017. My entry into the field.
> Blockchain Lab. No React, no fancy frameworks.
> Raw JavaScript, Linux, Mongo D B for data, and web interfaces that talk directly to machines.
> That's where I learned that code isn't just lines on a screen.
> It's a living system that needs to stand on its own.

---

## Act 2: Scaling Up (~24s)

> 2019. Desjardins Insurance.
> Not a startup. A financial institution with strict security requirements.
> Clusters of virtual machines handling millions in insurance.
> Suddenly, my code alone wasn't enough anymore.
> I needed secure pipelines, automation, systems that deploy themselves across dev, Q A, and Prod.
> Azure I A M management, security gates, compliance. Secure cloud became my playground.

---

## Act 3: The Creative (~20s)

> 2022. Change of direction.
> Sarbakan, a video game studio.
> A world where code has to be beautiful and fast at the same time.
> Unity, C sharp, React. My first encounter with data-oriented programming.
> Distributed systems from DevOps meeting real-time game development.

## Act 3.5: The S Q D C Initiative (~18s)

> Then S Q D C.
> A simple job that leaves me energy to code at night.
> And that's exactly what I do.
> The S Q D C Products Portal, I built it quickly — a tool for the advisors.
> While I work during the day, I build at night.

---

## Act 4: The Multiplier (~26s)

> 2024. The decisive turning point.
> A E C in Artificial Intelligence. But it wasn't just learning a new skill.
> A I is a multiplier of everything I already knew how to do.
> My projects prove it.
> Deep reinforcement learning in pure C sharp. Enemies that learn while you play.
> Local large language models that collaborate. Mongo D B for data, Neo four jay for relationships.
> Today, I don't code alone anymore. I orchestrate agents that code for me.

---

## Outro (~12s)

> There you go. Eight years summarized in a few minutes.
> From a programmer typing code to an architect directing agents.
> The tables have turned.
> If you want to chat, my email is right there.

## TTS Notes

These scripts are optimized for text-to-speech:
- **Spaced acronyms**: "A I", "Q A", "L L M", "E C S", "A E C", "I A M", "S Q D C"
- **C#** → "C sharp"
- **MongoDB** → "Mongo D B"
- **Neo4j** → "Neo four jay"
- **VM** → "virtual machines"
